                    How does the frozen bread subscription work?

                    <p>
                        Each month we bake fresh bread, freeze it immediately to lock in quality, 
                        and deliver it straight to your door. You’ll receive your bread ready to 
                        store in the freezer and enjoy whenever you want.

                        Keep the bread in the freezer. When you’re ready to eat it, simply defrost 
                        at room temperature or warm it in the oven for a few minutes.

                        Yes — all of our bread is handmade in small batches, using traditional 
                        slow-fermentation methods.

        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>
            Frozen Bread started as a simple love for homemade sourdough and a desire 
            to reduce food waste. We wanted bread that tastes incredible, lasts longer, 
            and fits into busy modern life — without compromising quality.
        </p>

        <p>
            So we created a small-batch frozen bread service that delivers 
            fresh-baked loaves straight to your freezer. 
            No preservatives. No mass production. Just real, honest bread.
        </p>

                    Together, we experiment, taste-test, bake at home, 
                    and deliver the loaves we personally eat every week.
